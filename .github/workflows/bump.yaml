      # Apparently, git pushes from workflows don't trigger other workflows
      # (to prevent infinite recursion, at the very least)
      # so the publish has to be done within the same workflow as the version bump.
      # And must not do checkout in it since it would checkout
      # the original workflow-toggling commit, not the version-bump commit.
